#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file

# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created

# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

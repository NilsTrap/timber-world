# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Nils
**Date:** 2026-01-04

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Simple company website for Timber International showcasing what the business does

**Goals:**
- Generate creative ideas for website design (visual, aesthetic choices)
- Explore website logic and structure (navigation, user flow, information hierarchy)
- Identify what makes a timber/wood industry site authentic and trustworthy

### Context Guidance

This session focuses on software/product development considerations including:
- User experience and interaction design
- Technical approaches for implementation
- Market differentiation opportunities
- Success metrics for the website

### Session Setup

Nils is looking to build a simple but effective company website for Timber International. The brainstorming will explore both the visual design language and the underlying structural logic that will make the site intuitive and purposeful for visitors.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Company website with focus on design ideas and structural logic

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Role Playing** *(Collaborative)* - Explore the website from multiple stakeholder perspectives to understand user needs and expectations
2. **Analogical Thinking** *(Creative)* - Draw inspiration from successful patterns both within and outside the timber industry
3. **SCAMPER Method** *(Structured)* - Systematically generate design and structure ideas through seven innovation lenses

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from understanding users → finding inspiration → systematic idea generation, creating a comprehensive foundation for website design decisions.

## Technique Execution Results

### Technique 1: Role Playing

**Perspectives Explored:** Potential Client, Competitor/Industry Peer

**Key Discoveries:**

1. **Two distinct buyer journeys:**
   - **Urgent buyers:** Need stock immediately, willing to pay 25-40% premium, delivery in days
   - **Long-term buyers:** Production orders, 6-8 week lead time, regular supply relationships

2. **Product groups to showcase:**
   - Solid wood panels (FJ - finger jointed, FS - full stave)
   - Finished products (steps, table tops, handrails, posts)
   - Additional services (varnishing, CNC, custom designs)

3. **The "manufacturing partner" value proposition:**
   - For UK/Norway markets especially, additional services aren't add-ons
   - Clients outsource manufacturing to focus on sales/product development
   - High labor costs make in-house production unviable for some

4. **Universal trust signal = Visual production journey:**
   - Forest → Logs → Sawmill → Kilns → Elements → Panels/Products → CNC/Finishing
   - This full-chain story matters to ALL visitors (buyers, partners, competitors)
   - Visual proof of each stage = credibility backbone

5. **B2B professional audience:**
   - Customers are furniture factories, carpentries, stair installers
   - They understand timber - no educational content needed
   - Website should speak peer-to-peer, not teacher-to-student

6. **Tone insight:**
   - Professional, confident but not aggressive
   - Cooperation-friendly (refers business to competitors when appropriate)
   - Welcoming to potential partners

### Technique 2: Analogical Thinking

**Inspiration Sources:** B2B manufacturing sites, machinery companies, edwood.pl reference

**Key Discoveries:**

1. **What impresses on B2B sites:**
   - Serious machinery and premises photos
   - Numbers showing scale (output, employees, capacity)
   - Visual proof of production capabilities

2. **The business model revelation - "Production Orchestrator":**
   - Timber International is NOT a traditional manufacturer
   - They're a production management company / supply chain expert
   - They own & control the wood (core asset)
   - They manage quality throughout the process
   - They coordinate production across trusted partners
   - Similar model to: IKEA, Apple, Nike - orchestrate, don't own everything

3. **Two parallel processes exist:**
   - Full production: Own the logs → control every step → finished product
   - Strategic resale: Source from partners → quality check → deliver to client
   - Website should NOT differentiate these to customers

4. **Positioning challenge & solution:**
   - Risk: Looking like weak middlemen without resources
   - Solution: Focus on CONTROL and ACCOUNTABILITY, not asset ownership
   - Language: "We control every step" (true) vs. "We own every machine" (unnecessary)
   - Show the production journey - it implies quality naturally

5. **Proposed positioning language:**
   - "From forest to finished product - we control every step"
   - "We source, we produce, we deliver. One partner, complete accountability"
   - Don't explain business structure - just show results and process

6. **Numbers alternative (since company is still growing):**
   - Years of experience
   - Countries delivered to
   - Production partners in network
   - Customer retention / satisfaction

7. **Visual approach:**
   - Show full production journey (logging, sawmill, kilns, machinery, CNC, finishing)
   - Don't need separate "quality control" showcase - production visuals imply it
   - Simple text mention: "Double-checked before leaving our warehouse"

### Technique 3: SCAMPER Method

**Systematic idea generation through seven lenses:**

#### S - SUBSTITUTE
- Static product list → Interactive database with filters
- "About Us" history → Visual production journey
- Generic contact form → Smart quotation system
- Stock photos → Real production photos (AI-enhanced)

#### C - COMBINE
- Product catalog + live stock availability
- Multi-product quotation (add items, submit once)
- Form + Chatbot (user chooses preferred method)
- Two pricing paths: Stock (show price) vs Production (request quote)

**Two Product Categories Identified:**
1. **Standard products** (solid wood panels, steps, handrails): Filterable, price visible
2. **Custom products**: Flexible quotation form, ~10 required questions

#### A - ADAPT
- B2B customer portal with order history (Phase 2)
- Reorder/edit past orders functionality (Phase 2)
- NOT needed: Shopping cart, configurator (customers know what they want)

#### M - MODIFY
- **Languages:** English base + auto-translate (Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian) - only if fully automated
- **Response times:** Standard quotes within 1 hour (auto-calculated), Custom within 24 hours
- **Images:** Real photos + AI enhancement
- **Pricing:** Stock = transparent, Production = behind quote (captures leads)

#### E - ELIMINATE
- ~~Blog/News section~~ - maintenance burden
- ~~Social media feeds~~ - distracting
- ~~Live human chat~~ - chatbot only for Phase 1
- ~~Detailed company history~~ - production journey tells the story
- ~~Multiple contact forms~~ - one smart system
- ~~Pushy sales approach~~ - pull through beauty & curiosity

#### R - REVERSE
- Information-first → **Emotion-first experience**
- Corporate/sterile → **Artistic, immersive**
- "Here's what we sell" → **"Here's what we believe"**
- Typical B2B → **Goosebumps-inducing opening**

**Homepage Vision:**
1. **Hero:** Full-screen forest photo/video + powerful slogan + logo
   - Feeling: Tranquility, sustainability, timelessness, goosebumps
   - One sentence, one powerful visual
2. **Scroll:** Production journey with emotional storytelling
   - Nature, oak, longevity, tradition, generations
   - Manual care, human touch, seriousness
   - Vertical integration = best quality-price message woven throughout
3. **Navigation:** Products, Quote, Contact - always accessible

**Product Page Vision:**
- **Layout:** Side panel filters (left) + Results table (right)
- **Filter behavior:** Checkboxes, all checked by default → uncheck to exclude
- **Filter categories:** Species, width, length, thickness, quality, FJ/FS, moisture, finish, FSC certification
- **Pricing columns:** Per m³, per piece, per m²
- **Action:** Select items → Request quote including transport
- **Style:** Clean, elegant - matches premium brand aesthetic (not raw spreadsheet)

**Phased Development:**
- **Phase 1:** Core website (homepage, journey, products, quotes, industry resources)
- **Phase 2:** B2B portal, recruitment, partner systems, ERP features

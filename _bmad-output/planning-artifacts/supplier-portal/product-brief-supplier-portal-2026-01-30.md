# Product Brief: Supplier Portal (Supplier Discovery & Engagement Platform)

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Session Notes (In Progress)

**Status:** Step 2 (Vision Discovery) in progress - awaiting user input

**Context loaded from brainstorming session:**
- Core Problem: Can't take small/custom orders profitably - sourcing suppliers manually takes too much time
- Proposed Solution: AI-powered supplier discovery with deep profiling and automated RFQ distribution
- Key Differentiator: "Precision AI Matchmaking" - only TOP 5 best-fit suppliers, not bulk spam

**Questions pending user response:**
1. Who feels this pain most acutely? (You, sales team, or clients?)
2. What's the cost of the current problem? (Lost orders? Time? Relationships?)
3. Why now? (AI capabilities? Business growth? Market opportunity?)
4. What's your unfair advantage? (Existing relationships? Domain expertise? Platform access?)

# Product Brief: Timber International Website

## Executive Summary

Timber International requires a new company website to replace an outdated 5-year-old landing page. The website will serve dual purposes: as a credibility confirmation platform for prospects already engaged through sales agents, AND as a compelling first impression for cold visitors discovering the company through advertising, search engines, or industry channels.

The website must evoke emotional connection through stunning visuals of the production journey—from forest to finished product—while providing practical functionality through an interactive product catalog with live inventory and pricing, plus a smart quotation system.

**Core positioning:** "Production Orchestrator" - a company that owns and controls the wood, manages quality throughout the entire process, and delivers with complete accountability. The website must communicate trust, sustainability, longevity, and craftsmanship without explicitly claiming factory ownership.

**Success criteria:** Whether visitors arrive after sales agent contact, from advertising, or through organic discovery - they should feel immediate trust and recognition that Timber International is exactly who they want to work with.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Timber International's current web presence is an outdated 5-year-old landing page that fails to represent the company's true capabilities, quality standards, and values. As the company launches an active sales expansion with local agents across multiple European markets, there is no digital asset that confirms and reinforces the sales message or creates strong first impressions for cold discovery.

### Problem Impact

- Sales agents cannot direct prospects to a credible online presence
- Cold visitors discovering the company online find outdated, unconvincing information
- Lost opportunities from both warm referrals AND cold discovery channels
- No mechanism to showcase inventory, pricing, or request quotes online
- The company's values (sustainability, quality, craftsmanship) are not visually communicated
- Competitors with better websites appear more established and trustworthy

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

The current landing page:
- Visually outdated and does not reflect the company's quality standards
- Contains only basic information with no product catalog
- No pricing transparency or inventory visibility
- No quotation system for potential clients
- Fails to tell the "forest to finished product" story that differentiates Timber International
- Does not evoke the emotional connection needed to convert leads into clients

### Proposed Solution

An emotion-first B2B website that:

1. **Opens with impact:** Full-screen forest imagery/video with a powerful slogan creating an immediate emotional connection ("goosebumps") - works equally for first-time visitors and returning prospects

2. **Tells the story:** Visual production journey (forest → logs → sawmill → kilns → panels → CNC → finishing) with minimal text, conveying vertical integration and quality control

3. **Enables business:** Interactive product catalog with side-panel filters, live inventory, transparent stock pricing, and smart quotation system (form + chatbot)

4. **Builds trust:** Industry resources page demonstrating expertise; professional aesthetic throughout

5. **Captures leads:** Production orders require quote requests, capturing prospect data for sales follow-up

### Key Differentiators

1. **"Production Orchestrator" positioning:** Focus on control and accountability rather than asset ownership - similar to how IKEA, Apple, and Nike operate

2. **Emotion-first B2B:** Unlike typical sterile industrial websites, this site creates visceral emotional response while maintaining professional functionality

3. **Transparency:** Stock prices shown openly; only production orders require quotes

4. **Dual buyer path:** Serves both urgent buyers (stock, premium price, instant) and long-term partners (production, better price, relationship)

5. **Sales enablement focus:** Designed to work for both warm referrals (confirmation) and cold discovery (first impression)

### Secondary Users

#### Resellers & DIY Shops (NOT Primary Target)

**Profile:**

**Strategic Note:**
- Currently a customer segment, but NOT the target for this website
- Goal: Reach end customers (furniture producers, installers) directly
- Website should appeal to end users, not optimize for reseller relationships

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Indicator

**Quote Requests via Website**
- **Current Baseline:** 0 (no functionality exists)
- **Target:** 50 quote requests per month (~10 per week)
- **Why This Matters:** With approximately 50% conversion rate from quote to deal (due to competitive pricing), this represents ~25 potential new customer relationships per month

### What Cannot Be Directly Measured

- **Reputation lift:** How much the professional website improves brand perception
- **Trust confirmation:** The "goosebumps" effect when prospects see the production journey
- **Competitive positioning:** How often prospects choose Timber International because the website convinced them vs. other factors

These unmeasurable factors are real and valuable - the website's emotional impact and credibility function matter even if they can't be tracked with numbers.

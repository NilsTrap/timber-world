# Product Requirements Document - Timber-International

**Author:** Nils
**Date:** 2026-01-08

## Executive Summary

Timber International requires a new company website to replace an outdated 5-year-old landing page. The website will serve dual purposes: as a credibility confirmation platform for prospects already engaged through sales agents, AND as a compelling first impression for cold visitors discovering the company through advertising, search engines, or industry channels.

The site will feature an immersive visual production journey from forest to finished product, an interactive product catalog with live inventory and transparent stock pricing, and a smart quotation system combining structured forms with an AI-powered chatbot.

**Core Positioning:** "Production Orchestrator" - a company that owns and controls the wood, manages quality throughout the entire process, and delivers with complete accountability.

**Primary Target Users:**
- **Furniture Producers:** Custom furniture workshops needing regular oak panel supply
- **Installers:** Stair/kitchen top installers seeking stock parts or complete ready-to-install packages

**Success Criteria:** Whether visitors arrive after sales agent contact, from advertising, or through organic discovery - they should feel immediate trust and recognition that Timber International is exactly who they want to work with. Target: 50 quote requests per month.

### What Makes This Special

1. **"Production Orchestrator" Model:** Like IKEA, Apple, and Nike - Timber International controls the wood from forest to finished product, managing quality throughout the chain. The focus is on control and accountability, not asset ownership.

2. **Emotion-First B2B:** Unlike typical sterile industrial websites, this site creates visceral emotional response ("goosebumps") through stunning forest imagery and production journey visuals while maintaining professional B2B functionality.

3. **Transparency:** Stock prices shown openly; only production orders require quotes - respecting the buyer's intelligence and time.

4. **Dual Buyer Paths:** Serves both urgent buyers (stock, premium price, instant availability) and long-term partners (production orders, better pricing, relationship building).

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** web_app
**Domain:** general (B2B manufacturing/supply chain)
**Complexity:** Low
**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project

This is a B2B web application with interactive catalog features, multi-language support (auto-translate), and conversational AI for quotations. No high-complexity regulatory requirements apply. Standard web best practices for SEO, accessibility, and performance will guide implementation.

## Success Criteria

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Erik Lindqvist - Discovering Something Better (Furniture Producer)

Erik runs a 12-person furniture workshop in Gothenburg, Sweden, crafting custom dining tables and cabinets. He's been working with the same oak panel supplier for years - they're fine, reliable enough, and he doesn't think much about it. Sourcing materials is just part of the routine.

One day, a Timber International sales agent reaches out - a cold email, a call, or maybe a visit if Erik's workshop is local. The agent explains: "We can supply the same oak panels you're buying now - better price, better quality, faster delivery." Erik is skeptical but curious. The agent sends him the website link.

That evening, Erik opens the site. The forest imagery catches his attention - this isn't a typical supplier website. As he scrolls through the production journey - forest to logs to sawmill to kilns to finished panels - something clicks. These people actually control the whole process. They're not middlemen. They're for real.

He checks the product catalog and finds his usual specification. He sees the stock price, but since he makes the same furniture repeatedly, he knows he can plan ahead. He requests a production quote instead - and discovers the price is 25% lower than stock, 20% lower than his current supplier. The trade-off is 6-8 weeks lead time, but Erik can plan around that.

He submits a quote request for a production order. The response comes within an hour with exact pricing and timeline. He places a trial order. Six weeks later, the panels arrive - quality matches the promise. Erik starts planning his orders in advance, stocking up through production runs. Occasionally, when an urgent project comes in, he orders from stock at premium prices - but that's rare. Within six months, Timber International has become his primary source.

### Journey 2: Anna Kowalski - From Cutting to Installing (Installer)

Anna runs a stair installation business in Oslo with a crew of 8. They handle everything from residential staircases to commercial handrail projects across southern Norway. Currently, she buys oak panels and treads from local DIY shops or material suppliers - convenient but expensive, and her team spends hours cutting and finishing on-site or in their small workshop.

A Timber International sales agent contacts her after finding her company through an industry directory. "What if you could receive complete stair packages - treads, risers, handrails - all CNC-cut to your exact measurements, varnished, and ready to install?" Anna is intrigued but cautious. She's dealt with suppliers who promised quality and delivered problems. The agent sends her the website.

Anna opens the site that weekend. The production journey resonates - she can see the kilns, the CNC machines, the finishing line. These aren't just panel sellers; they can actually manufacture to specification. She explores the product catalog and sees standard stair components, but what catches her attention is the quotation system.

She has an upcoming residential project - a 14-step straight staircase with matching handrails. She submits a detailed quote request through the form, specifying exact dimensions, wood species, and finish. Within 24 hours, she receives a complete quote: all components CNC-cut to her measurements, varnished in her specified finish, packed and delivered to the job site. The price is 30% less than sourcing materials locally and finishing them herself - and her crew saves two days of prep work.

She places the order. Six weeks later, the package arrives on-site. Her installers unpack, position, and install. No cutting, no finishing, no workshop time. The client is impressed with the quality. Anna realizes she can take on more projects now that her crew isn't tied up with material prep. She starts submitting project specs regularly, turning Timber International into her manufacturing partner.

### Journey 3: Marcus Virtanen - The Field Sales Agent

Marcus is a Timber International sales agent covering Finland. He spends most of his week visiting furniture workshops and installation companies, building relationships and finding new customers. Before the new website, his sales conversations relied on printed catalogs, PDF price lists, and his word - prospects had to trust him without much to back it up.

Now, when Marcus visits a potential customer like a cabinet maker in Tampere, he opens the Timber International website on his tablet during the conversation. "Let me show you where your panels actually come from," he says, scrolling through the production journey. The prospect leans in - this is different from the usual sales pitch.

When pricing comes up, Marcus navigates to the product catalog. "Here's your specification - you can see our stock price right now. And if you order production runs, we're talking 25% less." The prospect can verify everything Marcus claims. No more "I'll send you a quote later" - the transparency builds trust in real-time.

After the meeting, Marcus sends a follow-up email with a link to the website. The prospect explores on their own, submits a quote request that evening, and Marcus gets notified. He's gone from "salesman making promises" to "guide introducing a credible partner."

### Journey 4: Katri Nieminen - The Content Manager

Katri manages product data at Timber International's head office. Every week, inventory levels change - new stock arrives, orders deplete existing quantities, prices adjust based on market conditions. Before the website, this meant updating spreadsheets and hoping the sales team had current information.

Now, Katri's workflow is streamlined. On Monday morning, she exports the latest inventory data from their internal system - stock quantities, incoming production batches, current pricing. She uploads the file to the website's admin panel. The system validates the data, flags any anomalies (a price that seems too low, a quantity that doesn't match expected levels), and she confirms the update.

Within minutes, the product catalog reflects reality. When a customer in Sweden checks oak panel availability at 2 PM, they see what's actually in stock - not last week's numbers. Katri monitors for any upload errors, handles occasional manual corrections, and runs a weekly reconciliation to ensure the website matches their ERP. Her goal: zero discrepancy between what customers see and what Timber International can actually deliver.

### Journey 5: Johan Eriksen - The Analytics Admin

Johan handles digital operations at Timber International. The company has invested in this new website, and leadership wants to know: is it working?

Every Monday, Johan opens the analytics dashboard. He checks the key metrics: website visitors (broken down by country), time spent on production journey page, product catalog engagement, and most importantly - quote requests submitted. He compares this week to last week, this month to last month.

He notices patterns. Visitors from Norway spend twice as long on the site as visitors from Germany. The production journey page has a 70% scroll completion rate - people are actually watching the whole story. But there's a drop-off: 40% of users who start a quote request don't finish it. Johan flags this for the team - maybe the form needs simplification.

When a new marketing campaign launches targeting Swedish furniture makers, Johan tracks the traffic spike and follows those visitors through to quote submissions. He reports back: "The campaign brought 200 new visitors, 35 reached the product catalog, 12 submitted quotes." This data shapes the next campaign. Johan turns website activity into business intelligence.

### Journey 6: Lisa Andersen - The Quote Handler (Inside Sales)

Lisa works at Timber International's office, managing incoming quote requests. She's the bridge between website leads and actual orders. Her day starts with a queue of overnight submissions - customers from different time zones requesting prices.

A quote request comes in from Erik's furniture workshop - production order, oak panels, specific dimensions, delivery to Gothenburg. Lisa checks the specifications against available production capacity, calculates transport costs, and generates a quote. For standard products like this, the system does most of the work - she reviews, adjusts if needed, and sends. Response time: 45 minutes.

Another request is more complex - Anna's stair installation project with custom CNC cutting and varnishing. Lisa needs to consult with production planning for lead times and get finishing costs confirmed. She sends an acknowledgment to Anna immediately ("We received your request, detailed quote within 24 hours"), then coordinates internally. By end of day, Anna has her complete quote.

Lisa also handles follow-ups. A quote sent three days ago hasn't gotten a response - she sends a friendly check-in. A customer has questions about specifications - she answers directly or loops in the relevant sales agent. Her goal: fast, accurate responses that convert website interest into actual orders.
